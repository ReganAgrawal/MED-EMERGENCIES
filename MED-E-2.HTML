<h2 class="display-6 text-muted">3.Heart Attack</h2>
<p>A blockage of blood flow to the heart muscle.
    A heart attack is a <b><i>"medical emergency"</i></b>. A heart attack usually occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to the heart. Without blood, tissue loses oxygen and dies.
    Symptoms include tightness or pain in the chest, neck, back or arms, as well as fatigue, lightheadedness, abnormal heartbeat and anxiety. Women are more likely to have atypical symptoms than men.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="display-6">First Aid:</h3>
<h4>CPR(Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)</h4>
<p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an emergency procedure that combines chest compressions often with artificial ventilation in an effort to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest.</p>

<h2 class="display-6 text-muted">4.Drowning</h2>
<h4>CPR</h4>
<p>Drowning is a type of suffocation induced by the submersion or immersion of the mouth and nose in a liquid. ... An incident of drowning can also cause further complications for victims due to low body temperature, aspiration of vomit, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (respiratory failure from lung inflammation).</p>

<h1 class="display-4 text-dark">Burns</h1>
<h2 class="display-5 text-dark">Burning Levels</h2>

    <h3>First-Level Burn<h3>
    <h3>Second-Level Burn<h3>
    <h3>Third-Level Burn<h3>
<br>
<p>First-level burns are mild (like most sunburns). The top layer of skin (epidermis) turns red and is painful but doesn't typically blister.</p>
<p>Second-level burns affect skin's top and lower layers (dermis).</p>
<p>Third-level burns affect all three skin layers: epidermis, dermis and fat.</p>
<p>Fourth Level Lead to death</p>
<h2 class="display-6">5.Water Burn</h2>
<p>Burns are caused by dry heat from a fire, hot iron, or stove. A burn caused by something wet — like steam or hot water — is called a scald.</p><br>
<p>Hot water scalding can cause pain and damage to the skin from moist heat or vapors. This type of burn can be dangerous because it destroys affected tissues and cells. Your body may even go into shock from the heat. In more serious cases, these burns can be life-threatening.</p>

<h2 class="display-6">6.Thermal Burn</h2>


<p>A thermal burn is a type of burn resulting from making contact with heated objects, such as boiling water, steam, hot cooking oil, fire, and hot objects. Scalds are the most common type of thermal burn suffered by children, but for adults thermal burns are most commonly caused by fire.</p>

<h4 class="display-6">First Aid</h4>

<p>Take off jewelry, belts, and tight clothing. Burns can swell quickly.</p>
<p>Hold burned skin under cool (not cold) running water or immerse in cool water until the pain subsides.</p>
<p>Use compresses if running water isn't available.</p>
<p>Cover with sterile, non-adhesive bandage or clean cloth.</p>
<p>Do not apply butter, oil, lotions, or creams (especially if they contain fragrance). Apply a petroleum-based ointment two to three times per day.</p>
<p>Give over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Panadol, Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).</p>
<p>Shift the patient to a burn ward in a hospital <i><b>"AS SOON AS POSSIBLE"</b></i></p>

<h2 class="display-6">7.Electrical burn</h4>
<p>An electrical burn is a skin burn that happens when electricity comes in contact with your body.</p>
<p>When electricity comes in contact with your body, it can travel through your body. When this happens, the electricity can damage tissues and organs. This damage can be mild or severe – and it can even cause death</p>
<p>Apply Ice Pack, Put your hands in running water, AND SHIFT THE PATIENT TO hospital <b><i>"AS SOON AS POSSIBLE"</i></b></p>

<br><br><br>
<h2 class="display-6">8.Chemical Burn</h2>
<p>A chemical burn occurs when your skin or eyes come into contact with an irritant, such as an acid or a base. Chemical burns are also known as caustic burns. They may cause a reaction on your skin or within your body. These burns can affect your internal organs if chemicals are swallowed.
